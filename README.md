### nixos-configs
This is my personal /etc/nixos directory. 

The main configuration lies in configuration.nix. 

I don't use flakes much, so its mostly empty.

### sync-nixos.sh?
The file basically pushes changes whenever I rebuild nixos. I did this so I don't have to manually edit this repository. Feel free to copy it and use it as an executable if you'd like.
